Ever wanted to download the full list of games you have in your steam library?

If you did - here you go, a script just for that.

## Usage:
- install sbt
- `sbt "run -usr <your profile id> -api <api key> -f <result file path>"`

### FQA:
- You can use a custom profile id(meaning one that you set up yourself, no one that steam has assigned to you)
- You can get your api key [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

## Plans:
- more spreadsheets, for game suggestions and such
- better looking spreadsheets (trying to figure out how styling works)
